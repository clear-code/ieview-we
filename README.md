# IE View WE MV3

Provides ability to open pages and links by other browsers.

This was initially started as a cloned IE View based on WebExtensions API, but finally dropped support of original IE View compatible features including the options page.
Only ThinBridge compatible implementation is left on the browser extension part, thus you need to install [ThinBridge](https://github.com/ThinBridge/ThinBridge/) as the native messaging host.
See [ThinBridge](https://github.com/ThinBridge/ThinBridge/) for more details.
