# IE View WE MV3

Provides ability to open pages and links by other browsers.

This was initially started as a cloned IE View based on WebExtensions API, but finally dropped support of original IE View compatible features including the options page.
Only ThinBridge compatible implementation is left on the browser extension part, thus you need to install [ThinBridge](https://github.com/ThinBridge/ThinBridge/) as the native messaging host.
See [ThinBridge](https://github.com/ThinBridge/ThinBridge/) for more details.

IE View WE MV3 msut be loaded via GPO.
See [the document describing how to install development version of the extension via GPO, in the TinBridge project](https://github.com/ThinBridge/ThinBridge/blob/master/DEVELOPMENT.md#how-to-try-extensions-for-development).
